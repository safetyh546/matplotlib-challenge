# matplotlib-challenge
This challenge was to study two csv files, with study data of various drugs impact on tumor volume.
Mouse_metadata.csv contained mouse information with mouseID, age, weight, and the drug regimen they were being treated with.
study_results.csv containted the MouseID and the study data like time of measurement, tumor volume, etc.
The Jupyter notebook Pymaceuticals analyzes the combined dataset looking at counts, averages, and displaying bar, line, and pie charts.
It also has boxplots for 4 drug regiments of interest.  And a scatter plot of Mouse weight and average tumor volume for mice treated with Capomulin.
